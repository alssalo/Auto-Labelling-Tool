# Auto-Labelling-Tool

Below are the steps to setup this application.
1. To run this code first we have to setup tensorflow object detection API.Below is the link to for its setup.
               https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md

2. Download and extract any model files(Any 3) to models/research/object_detection folder.Below is the link to download.
               https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md

3. Next copy the test_main.py python file to models/research/object_detection folder

4. Copy detection.py in utils to models/research/object_detection folder/utils folder.

5. Run test_main.py in cmd.
